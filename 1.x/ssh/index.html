        <h1 id="ssh">SSH</h1>
<p>We use SSH in two widely different ways.</p>
<h2 id="inter-container-communication">Inter-container communication</h2>
<p>Because the configuration of containers is made through Ansible, the main controller needs to be able to SSH to any container - or, to be precise, to any container based on the main ce-dev-base image.
This uses a short-lived private/public keys pair, re-generated everytime the controller is re-started. There is thus no risk of someone accessing a running container with a &ldquo;generic&rdquo; publicly known key.
It is hold in a separate volume, <code>ce_dev_ssh</code>, mounted on all containers and owned by the &lsquo;ce-dev&rsquo; user. This avoids exporting it by mistake if you build an image based on those containers (which would be mostly harmless, as those are re-generated anyway).</p>
<h2 id="external-communication">External communication</h2>
<p>Access to private resources - think cloning private repos, syncing back environments, <code>drush sql-sync</code> or anything advanced - from within the container would normally not be possible without a circumvoluted setup of ssh agent forwarding. You can easily enable it on an individual basis.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up">Setting up</h3>
<p>For each project, in the top level &ldquo;x-ce-dev&rdquo; entry, you can specify a list of hosts that will need to be accessed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#66d9ef">x-ce_dev</span>:
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">ssh_hosts</span>:
    - dev.example.com
    - github.com
</code></pre></div><p>When you first setup such a project with <code>ce-dev init</code>, you will be prompted for a username and private key to use for each of the hosts. The default values for those can be altered in your global 
<a href="https://codeenigma.github.io/ce-dev-docs/1.x/userconfig" >user config</a>
.</p>
<p><em>Side note: in case you are wondering what username to use for gitlab.com/github.com or any git server &hellip; it doesn&rsquo;t matter, use whatever. It&rsquo;ll be always be git@ anyway</em></p>
<h3 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h3>
<p>How does it work? How secure is this?</p>
<p>On <code>ce-dev init</code>, all we store the combo of host, username and filepath to the key in the project&rsquo;s config. When <code>ce-dev start</code> is called, we</p>
<ul>
<li>copy the private key from the host to memory (/dev/shm) on the guest container</li>
<li>generate an 
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">.ssh/config</a>
 file for the ce-dev user within the container that points to the temporary location</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to sum it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keys only reside in memory (RAM/tpmfs), it can&rsquo;t be exported by mistake as an image or shared, so never leaves your laptop/host machine</li>
<li>It only &ldquo;lives&rdquo; while your container is running, and containers are not reachable from outside your host (see 
<a href="#inter-container-communication" >Inter-container communication</a>
 above and the 
<a href="https://codeenigma.github.io/ce-dev-docs/1.x/networking" >networking</a>
 section for details).</li>
</ul>
<p>One might object that using a maliciously crafted image, an attacker could then gain access to that key. Keep in mind that this feature only is enabled for container based on the ce-dev-base image (ie, have an x-ce-dev entry in their service definition in the compose configuration), and that said attacker might also as well trick you in running a malicious script, .deb or .rpm package or anything with the same result.</p>
